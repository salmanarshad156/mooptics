                                                happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out

                                                Some of our external third party suppliers are based outside the UK so their processing of your
                                                personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK.
                                                <br><br>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of
                                                protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
                                                <br><br>• We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an
                                                adequate level of protection for personal data.
                                                <br><br>• Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in
                                                the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK.
                                                Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when

                                                than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this

                                                <br><br><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or
                                                those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want
                                                to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and
                                                freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct
                                                marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
                                                process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
                                                <br><br><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
                                                suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
                                                <br><br>• If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
                                                <br><br>• Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
                                                <br><br>• Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to
                                                establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
                                                <br><br>• You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
                                                legitimate grounds to use it.
                                                <br><br><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to
                                                you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
                                                machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you
                                                initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with
                                                you.
                                                <br><br><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
                                                However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
                                                consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to
                                                you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
